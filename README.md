# Server-Sent Event

It allows realtime communication between a server and a web client
so server and events enable server to push data to the client and
unlike websockets the SSE are unidirectional, which means the flow of
the data is from server to the client only.

Makes perfect for scenarios

- live news feed
- social media updates
- realtime analytics about dashboard

As long as connection of client and server is active the server keep on sending
new data to web page so server sent events solve the challenge in web
development in updating the client side with realtime information
without overloading server with requests.
